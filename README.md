**Overview**

The goal of this module is to show that opening a Citibike in Des Moines is profitable business using Tableau to process raw data and display the story. By showing trends pulled from Citibike data in NYC, data can be easily processed and display.

***Figure 1: We can see that most common bike trip is less than 20 minutes, as indicated by the peak. Furthermore, the graph displays that the majority of bike rides are no longer than 60 minutes. Seems that getting around NYC is quick given how condensed everything is.***

***Figure 2: This graph shows that males (yellow line) tend to use Citibike in NYC more than females (blue line). Though there is a decent number of unknowns (red line), we can still say the previous statement with a high degree of confidence. Regardless of gender, it seems that majority of people tend to use the bikes for less than an hour, as the previous figure showed.***

***Figure 3: The heatmap shows a few observations. First, the popular days of the week are Monday through Friday, which is expected given those are typical work days. Another observation is popular use of bike times are in the early morning and the evening. These are during rush hours when people go to & come back from work. Interesting that the unknown section does not display anything, suggesting that the users who use the bikes are guests without any profile information.***

***Figure 4: This heatmap shows the same conclusion as the previous figure, where Monday through Friday show popular times during the morning and evening (rush hour). HOwever, it is also interesting to note that the weekend has its fair use of riders as well, but more spreadout as there is not peak hours to use since people are more free to do so.***

***Figure 5: The figure displays a heatmap of customers versus subscribers in terms of usage & gender. The heatmap displays that most of the data  belongs to the subscribers given the color gradient. any other information can be interpretted from the previous figures.***

***Figure 6: A map that shows where the final destination of each user drops off the bike. Not surprisingly that majority of the bikes are located in the downtown area.***

***Figure 7: A bar graph that shows which hour of the day do people start using the Citibike ride & counts the number of users. We can see that the popular times are during the morning and during the evening, which is typical given those are rush hour timeframes.***


**Summary**

***Further Research***

Gathering further data can be beneficial to the data analyst and the investors. For starters, let's see the heatmap of traffic of NYC versus that of Des Moines. NYC is far more congested, which makes biking a lot more convenient to get around. Des Moines is the downtown of Iowa, but does that necessarily mean that driving around is as difficult? 
Another visualization is bar graph of how many people will ride the bikes if implemented in Des Moines. Just because it sounds good on paper does not mean that it will execute well. It's important to consider how many of the potential customers will intend on using it. 

***Conclusions***

As noted in each description of the figures, we can see that the majority of the users of Citibike in NYC are subscribers and males. Furthermore, the most popular times are during rush hour between Monday and Friday, with a general-spread during the day on the weekends. Finally, most of the bikes tend to be dropped off in the popular area of NYC. 
From a general stand-point, the investors have a good idea on the demographic of the users & when they use them.
